## Overview

This presentation outlines a machine learning project focused on predicting Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) playoff qualification using a decade of historical data. 

The project addresses the increasing demand for data-driven approaches in women's sports analytics. 

Key components include:
- data exploration
- cleaning
- feature engineering
- model evaluation (using accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score) 

The team employs a streamlined pipeline for model training, emphasizing the importance of precision in sports predictions. 
Results indicate promising outcomes, with attention to challenges faced, data quality, and the impact of feature selection and engineering.

The presentation goes into further detail on the project's motivation, methodology, and results.

The code was developed in Python 3.10 with Jupyter Notebook.

### Dependencies

The dependencies needed to run the code are present in the `requirements.txt` file. They can be installed using the following command:

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the code

The code is divided in 3 notebooks that can be ran in any order as they are independent from each other
